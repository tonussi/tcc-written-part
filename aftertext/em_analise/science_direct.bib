abstract = {The architectural style of microservices has been gaining popularity in recent years. In this architectural style, small and loosely coupled modules are deployed and scaled independently to compose cloud-native applications. Carrier-grade service providers are migrating their legacy applications to a microservice based architecture running on Kubernetes which is an open source platform for orchestrating containerized microservice based applications. However, in this migration, service availability remains a concern. Service availability is measured as the percentage of time the service is provisioned. High Availability (HA) is achieved when the service is available at least 99.999\% of the time. In this paper, we identify possible architectures for deploying stateful microservice based applications with Kubernetes and evaluate Kubernetes from the perspective of availability it provides for its managed applications. The results of our experiments show that the repair actions of Kubernetes cannot satisfy HA requirements, and in some cases cannot guarantee service recovery. Therefore, we propose an HA State Controller which integrates with Kubernetes and allows for application state replication and automatic service redirection to the healthy microservice instances by enabling service recovery in addition to the repair actions of Kubernetes. Based on experiments we evaluate our solution and compare the different architectures from the perspective of availability and scaling overhead. The results of our investigations show that our solution can improve the recovery time of stateful microservice based applications by 50\%.}
